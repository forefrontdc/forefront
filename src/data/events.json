She has come far since then from solving problems like fixing keyboard tabbing issues with JavaScript, automating accessibility checking using plugins like pa11y, and advising the clients why they should care. Her tech passion involves anything that merges technology and empathy—which makes it clear why accessibility is her area of expertise.
