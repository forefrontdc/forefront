She started learning about accessibility 3 years ago when she was told to fix a few bug tickets that came through an accessibility checker, and admittedly had no idea what she was doing.  She has come far since then from solving problems like fixing keyboard tabbing issues with JavaScript, automating accessibility checking using plugins like pa11y, and advising the clients why they should care. Her tech passion involves anything that merges technology and empathy—which makes it clear why accessibility is her area of expertise. Based in Washington, DC, she spends most of her free time reading, drinking craft beer, or lifting weights.",

Using the backdrop of human psychology and innate perceptions of time, Eli will unveil tips and tricks to manage perceived loading time (and more).</p><p>Before Eli takes the stage, we&rsquo;ll hear four lightning talks from devs in the community on some exciting topics.<br><ul><li>&ldquo;Flocc: An Agent-Based Modeling Framework in JavaScript&rdquo; by Scott Donaldson</li><li>&ldquo;Understanding Javascript Selectors With and Without Reselect&rdquo; by Pearl McPhee</li><li>&ldquo;Automated Accessibility Testing&rdquo; by Alex Barbato</li><li>&ldquo;How to Say Anything&rdquo; by Valerie Woolard Srinivasan</li></ul></p><p>All of this, plus bagels and coffee.
